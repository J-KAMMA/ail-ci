## 2026-10-23 - C compiler step cache (job-ctime3-10232149)

The base export already contains the content-addressed `cc` layer in
`AIL_CURRENT/python/pkg-v12/buildcache.py` (`buildcache.run_cc`, activated by `--cache`, stored under
`$AIL_CACHE` / `~/.cache/ail`, off with `AIL_NO_CACHE=1` or `--no-cache`). The task says not to add
a second cache when one already exists, so this job verifies and measures that layer and adds a
regression test for the exact reuse case:

* `test_changed_source_with_the_same_generated_c_hits_the_cc_cache` changes a typed local's name,
  which changes the merged source text (a new front-end entry) but not the generated C: the C
  compiler step is skipped and the executable is byte-identical.

Measurement on this 4-core runner, gcc 13.3, median of 5 runs, `AIL_CACHE` in a temporary
directory. "before" is `AIL_NO_CACHE=1`; "after" is a cache warm from the same C text with a new
front-end key (a renamed local), so the front end runs but the C compiler step hits. Wall time is
the whole `ail_chatgpt.py compile`; C time is the sum of the compiler wrapper's own runs (after
includes the cache's one-time toolchain probes).

| gdev program | wall before | C before | wall after | C after | outputs |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| g00_000 | 1.245 s | 0.241 s | 1.177 s | 0.013 s | identical |
| g00_002 | 1.427 s | 0.393 s | 1.186 s | 0.012 s | identical |
| g00_004 | 2.540 s | 1.418 s | 1.279 s | 0.012 s | identical |

Output SHA-256 values were equal for every before/after pair. With an unchanged source the whole
front-end cache also hits, so the compiler step is not run at all.

* fuzz21 (unpacking): the general path's `UNPACK_SEQUENCE` errors now use CPython's wording and
  counts -- `too many values to unpack (expected N)`, `not enough values to unpack (expected N, got M)`,
  `(expected at least N, got M)` for a starred target, and `cannot unpack non-iterable X object`.
  Added `AIL_CURRENT/test_ail_fuzz21.py` and registered it in `ail_check.MODULES`.
## 2026-10-23 - fuzz45: float // and % use CPython's float_divmod

The general path's boxed operators and the unified pass emitted `floor(a / b)` for float `//` and a
bare `fmod` for float `%`.  `1.0 // 0.1` was 10.0 (CPython 9.0), `-0.0 % 2.0` was -0.0 (CPython
0.0), `-5.0 // inf` was -0.0 (CPython -1.0) and `inf // 2.0` was inf (CPython nan).  Both now use
one CPython float_divmod helper, so `//`, `%` and `divmod` agree, including zero-remainder signs,
infinities and NaNs.  Added `test_ail_fuzz45.py` (5 programs, two builds each).
