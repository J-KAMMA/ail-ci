## 2026-10-24 - CPython codec-name normalization (job-rbpre23-10242019)

The first still-differing item from the task's list was the encoding-name normalization: `b"abc".decode("utf\t8")`,
`"abc".encode("iso-8859-1:1987")`, `bytes("abc", "iso-8859-1:1987")` and `str(b"\xe9", "ISO\t8859-1")` failed
with LookupError (or a compile-time refusal) while CPython accepts them. The bytes prelude now normalizes a
name the way `encodings.normalize_encoding` does (punctuation runs become one underscore, leading/trailing
punctuation is dropped) and matches the normal form against CPython's aliases for UTF-8, ASCII and Latin-1.
The general path's literal-codec check and the typed path's UTF-8 literal check use the same normalization, so
a literal name and a dynamic name agree. Unsupported names still raise LookupError (a literal one is refused
by name at compile time).

Probes in `/tmp/probes` (`p1`-`p5`) covered literal and dynamic names through an argument, list item,
attribute and dict value, encode/decode, `bytes()`/`str()`/`bytearray`, empty input, non-str types, aliases,
normalized punctuation, unknown names and codec width boundaries on both `cmp.sh` builds; `p3`/`p5` are
refused by name. `p4` also matches CPython on the typed path (`AIL_NO_GENERAL=1`) and both IR builds.
`test_ail_pre23.py` runs the literal and dynamic cases on both IR builds.

## 2026-10-24 - GC rooting in the statistics helpers (job-gcroot-10241807)

The general path's native `statistics` helpers kept a heap result in a C local across an
allocating call. `ail2q_partials` built its result list and then boxed every float in it, and
`ail2q_ssd_dd` boxed its first tuple element before allocating the second; both relied on
`AIL2Z_PAUSE` to stop collection. `AIL_GC_STRESS` collects at every allocation regardless of
the threshold, so the unrooted list/tuple elements were freed and overwritten:
AddressSanitizer reported a heap-use-after-free in `ail2q_partials` on
`corpus/gdev/g03_000.py` and `g03_018.py`. Both now register the live locals with
`AIL_ROOT1` / `AIL_ROOT_N` until the last allocation. Added
`test_ail_gcstress.PROGRAMS['statistics_partials']` and its test; it fails with the old
runtime and passes now. The analogous code in `jsonbrt.py` was checked: `ail_tuple_new`
already roots the item array it is given, so no change was needed there.
## 2026-10-24 - bytes.count memmem: self-contained declaration (job-perf7-10240917)

Review found the short-needle `bytes.count` path called `memmem` without a declaration in the
emitted C, so `gcc -std=c11` (a mode AIL uses for `to_c` and C-object builds) assumed an implicit
`int` return and truncated the pointer (segfault). The `BYTES` block now declares `memmem`
itself on non-Windows, after `<string.h>`; glibc and musl both export the symbol, and the
declaration is compatible with the header's when `_GNU_SOURCE`/`_DEFAULT_SOURCE` is set.
`rp7_count_small.py` now prints `4 2 2` under `-std=c11 -O2` and `-std=gnu17`; all count probes
match CPython on both builds, and `binary_search` is unchanged at 64.9 ms vs base 92.0 ms
(`ail/base 0.711 [0.706,0.717]`). Required tests pass.

## 2026-10-24 - bytes.count: memmem for short needles (job-perf7-10240917)

`binary_search` (`count` of a 7-byte needle over a 64 MiB file) spent ~69 ms of its 94 ms in
`ail_bytes_count_range`, which used the byte-pair Horspool scan. For a short needle glibc
`memmem` is about twice as fast on the same data (38 ms vs 71 ms), so the non-Windows
short-needle path now uses the same non-overlapping `memmem` loop as the C reference; Windows
keeps Horspool. `bench/compare.py --app binary_search`: base 98.2 ms, new 69.2 ms
(AIL/C 1.414 -> 0.994, ranges non-overlapping). Probes for empty, negative, windowed and
64-byte needles through arguments, list items, attributes and dict values match CPython on both
builds.
## 2026-10-23 - str format spec: a space sign names CPython's ValueError (job-pre18-10240245)

The first pre-existing difference recorded by the fuzz66 reviewer still reproduces on this tree:
`format('x', ' z')` raised `ValueError: Sign not allowed in string format specifier`, where CPython
says `Space not allowed in string format specifier`. The same wording bug covered every str spec
with a space sign.

`AIL_CURRENT/python/pkg-v12/safetyrt.py` now distinguishes the space flag from `+`/`-` in
`ail2f_format`'s str branch. `AIL_CURRENT/python/pkg-v12/pyboxed2.py` sends a str spec that carries
any sign to `safetyrt.FMT` instead of the core formatter, which silently ignored the flag (so
`format('x', '+')` returned `x` and `format('x', ' ')` padded it). Numeric sign flags and str specs
without a sign are unchanged.

`test_ail_pre18.py` covers the recorded case, all sign spellings, literal and computed specs,
widths/alignment, empty and non-ASCII values, values from an argument/list item/attribute/dict
value, and numeric sign formatting on both builds. It and `test_ail_safetynet`, `test_ail_files` and
`test_ail_corpus_findings3` pass on the final commit.
## 2026-10-24 - pre96: a parameter shadows a class name (job-pre96-10242044)

The general emitter's `expr_Name` returned the module-lifetime class value for every name
that matched a class definition, even when the current function had a local slot for that
name.  In `class U: ...; def f(U): return U.m()` the argument was ignored: both builds read
the class object and raised `AttributeError: 'type' object has no attribute 'm'`, where
CPython returns 42 from the instance's class attribute or method.  A class name now becomes
a class value only when the activation has no parameter, local, cell or closure binding for
it; a shadowing binding is loaded from its own slot.  This also covers a nested function's
parameter, a method parameter, and values arriving through a list item, an attribute and a
dict value.  `test_ail_pre96.py` keeps the probes; no emitted C changes for a program that
does not shadow a class name.
## 2026-10-24 - pre97: constant str.split/rsplit maxsplit

pre70's reviewer left qtest2's second item alone: a maxsplit constant above int64 compiled and
then stopped with `integer overflow` where CPython raises `OverflowError`, and `2**63 - 1` also
overflowed on the intermediate power although the final limit fits.  A constant maxsplit
expression is now folded exactly at compile time in the typed emitter and in the general
emitter (before its argument pre-evaluation): a value that fits is emitted as one int64 literal,
and a value above int64 is refused by name on both builds without evaluating a huge power.
`test_ail_pre97.py` covers both refusal forms and the in-range boundaries.
## 2026-10-24 - Counter missing keys through a dict value (job-pre98-10242046)

`table["k"]["y"] += 1` on a missing Counter key reached through a dict value raised `KeyError: 'y'`.
The general path's generic dict getitem only knew Counter's `__missing__` when the emitter could see
the static kind; a Counter reached through a dict value, an argument, a list item, an attribute, a
return value or an alias took the plain dict path. `ail_dict_getitem` now returns 0 without inserting
for a Counter (flag 1), and `ail2_aug_probe` does the same before the augmented store, so the missing
key starts at 0 and is inserted by the store. Plain dict misses and a missing outer key still raise
KeyError. Added `AIL_CURRENT/test_ail_pre98.py` (two programs, both builds) and registered it in
`ail_check.MODULES`. The separate `Counter({"a": "x"})` constructor difference was not changed.
## 2026-10-24 - pre109: negative shift count keeps CPython's ValueError

The typed `ck_shl`/`ck_shr` guards raised `ValueError` with no message, and `pymix` selected
a typed clone for a helper whose shift count was not a non-negative literal, so the clone's
`ValueError` could escape the caller's boxed `try` (also for `<<=`/`>>=`).  Both guards now
raise CPython's `negative shift count` (adopting the new exception, so a caught shift does not
leak), and `pymix` treats non-literal shift counts in `BinOp` and `AugAssign` as traps, so the
boxed caller keeps its handler.  `test_ail_pre109.py` covers constants, arguments, list items,
attributes, dict values, augmented shifts, valid shifts and an uncaught failure on both builds;
1,000,000 caught shifts keep maxrss at 11,564 KB.
## 2026-10-24 - bench table ratio bounds near 1.0 (job-pre110-10242223)

The bench2 review left one pre-existing display quirk: `numeric_scale_binary`'s ail/base ratio
printed `0.990 [0.981, 1.000] faster` even though the real upper bound was 0.9996.  A plain
`%.3f` rounded 0.9996 to 1.000, so the row looked like a tie while the verdict (computed from the
unrounded bounds) said faster.  `bench/compare.py`'s `fmt` now adds decimals only when 3-decimal
rounding would put a value on the wrong side of 1.0, so this row reads
`0.990 [0.981, 0.9996] faster`; ordinary ratios keep three decimals and the verdict rule is
unchanged.  No compiler or runtime file is touched.  `AIL_CURRENT/test_ail_pre110.py` pins the
below/above/tie/exact-one cases and the no-range median.
## 2026-10-24 - build time in the AIL/C/Rust comparison (job-bench2-10241946)

`bench/compare.py` now records build wall time in the existing post-timing build-disk pass: the median
of three cold builds (fresh build directory, `AIL_CACHE` and TMPDIR) and three incremental builds after
appending one harmless comment line to the app's AIL, C or Rust source with the caches warm. The JSON
has `build_time_ms` and the table has `cold build s ail/c/rust` and `incremental build s ail/c/rust`
beside the unchanged columns. The full run is in `bench/results/2026-10-24-buildtime.md`: AIL cold
builds took 2.02-7.12 s versus C 0.07-0.34 s and Rust 2.40-2.61 s; AIL incremental builds took
0.17-0.40 s. Timestamped cold compiles (LD_PRELOAD exec/exit log) spend 55-65% in the AIL front end,
31-44% in the C compiler and 2-3% linking. No language behaviour changed, so no DIFFERENCES row.
## 2026-10-24 -- pre100: `%d` of a float on the general path

CPython truncates a float for `%d` and prints the whole integer even past int64 (`"%d" % 1e20`
prints `100000000000000000000`). The literal-format path rejected a float with
`TypeError: unsupported format string passed to non-int`, and the run-time formatter stopped at
the int64 boundary with `AIL limit: integer overflow`. Literal `%d` conversions now go through
the run-time formatter (`pyboxed2._percent_format` -> `safetyrt.FMT`), and that formatter's
integer branch formats the truncated float as decimal digits directly instead of as an int64.
NaN and infinity keep CPython's ValueError / OverflowError. Probes:
`/tmp/probes/pre100_float_d*.py`, `pct_dynamic_float.py`; new test
`AIL_CURRENT/test_ail_pre100.py`.
## 2026-10-24 - pre101: `itertools.permutations(xs, None)` (job-pre101-10242138)

CPython treats an explicit `r=None` as "not given" and yields every full-length permutation.
The general path (`pyboxed2._lib_permutations`) passed the None through as r=0 and returned
`[()]`. It now treats a literal/keyword None as omitted and, for a value known only at run
time, passes `has_r = (r.tag != AIL_T_NONE)` so a None argument/attribute/list item/dict value
is handled the same way. The typed path already handled the literal None; a None-typed
variable is refused by name there (no null value), so the default build falls back to the
general path. `AIL_CURRENT/test_ail_pre101.py` covers both builds.
## 2026-10-24 - pre102: format() of None / an instance without __format__

The general runtime parsed the format spec before it dispatched on the value, so `format(None, ' +8')`
and `format(Box(1), ' +8')` raised `ValueError: Invalid format specifier` where CPython's
`object.__format__` rejects any non-empty spec with
`TypeError: unsupported format string passed to NoneType.__format__` (resp. `Box.__format__`).
`safetyrt.py` now does that rejection before `ail2f_parse`; str/int/bool/float keep parsing, and an
instance that defines `__format__` is still dispatched first by dunderrt. Added
`test_ail_pre102.py` (one program, both builds, values through an argument, list item, dict value,
attribute, f-string and str.format, plus an empty spec and a custom `__format__`).
The NUL / non-ASCII unknown-code difference (a NUL spec still formats as if empty) is pre-existing
and not touched by this job. Verified with `test_ail_pre102`, `test_ail_safetynet`,
`test_ail_files` and `test_ail_corpus_findings3`: 26 tests, all OK.

## 2026-10-24 - pre104: round() of nan/inf raises CPython's exception

The pre54 review recorded the default build's one-argument `round()` of nan/inf as a
pre-existing difference: it stopped through `ail_die` with `round() of nan` or
`round() result does not fit in this language's int64`, so a `try` could not catch it and an
uncaught program printed the trap message instead of CPython's exception line.  `ail_round0`
now raises `ValueError("cannot convert float NaN to integer")` and
`OverflowError("cannot convert float infinity to integer")` through the normal exception path
on both builds.  Finite values, including the int64-boundary trap, are unchanged.  Added
`AIL_CURRENT/test_ail_pre104.py` and registered it in `ail_check.MODULES`.
## 2026-10-24 - pre105: a multi-name import refusal names the unmodelled module

The exact errmsg3 case `import math, html` (with `html` used, so the general path refuses too)
reached the typed path's module scan, which joined every alias into one name and printed
`import of 'math, html' is not available` at the import's line.  That denied the supported
`math` and did not say which module was missing.  The scan now picks the first name outside the
modelled set (`html`, or `html.parser`) and names it alone; an unused `html` import still builds
on both paths.  Added `AIL_CURRENT/test_ail_pre105.py` (eight refusals, both builds, plus the
accepted unused case).
## 2026-10-24 - pre107: random.expovariate's default rate

Job cov8 recorded `gauss(mu)` / `expovariate()` without defaults as pre-existing. On this
tree `random.gauss(2.5)` already matches CPython on both builds; `random.expovariate()` and
`Random.expovariate()` were still refused because the two Random preludes declared
`expovariate(lambd)` without CPython 3.12's `lambd=1.0`. Both now default to 1.0.
The module-level function and a `Random` object match CPython after `random.seed(<int>)`,
including explicit int/float/negative/infinite rates, keyword calls, a zero rate's
`ZeroDivisionError`, and rates passed through an argument, a list item, an attribute and a
dict value. On this tree the default build reaches the general path for these programs:
the typed path still refuses `Random` for its plain-positional `randrange` requirement (an
unrelated pre-existing gap). Added `AIL_CURRENT/test_ail_pre107.py`.
## 2026-10-24 - statically known int64 constant overflow (job-pre108-10242222)

The pre-existing `ttypes.py` difference used `[9223372036854775807 * 2, ...]`: CPython prints
bignums, while AIL compiled the program and then stopped at run time with `integer overflow`. A new
front-end check evaluates integer constant expressions built from literals and module-level int
constants (`+`, `-`, `*`, and `**` with a non-negative exponent) and refuses an out-of-int64
result by name (`int64 constant expression out of range: ...`) on both the general and the default
build. The check is conservative: a module constant shadowed by a local or a parameter is not
folded, shifts keep their existing refusal messages, and values that only reach the operation at
run time still trap with `integer overflow`. Added `test_ail_pre108.py` and registered it in
`ail_check.MODULES`.
## 2026-10-24 - pre112: a frozenset of tuples as a dict key (job-pre112-10242224)

The tuple pass (`tuplib.py`) lowers `frozenset({(1, 'a'), (2, 'b')})` to its `_AilS_Pi_sQ` table class. The
table refuses a set as a key, so a dict keyed by that frozenset stays a plain object, but the same expression
used as the *lookup* key was still lowered: `D[frozenset({(1, 'a'), (2, 'b')})]` raised `KeyError`,
`frozenset(...) in D` was False and `D.get(...)` was None, while the dictionary itself printed correctly (the
reviewer's `t4h`, also on base). The pass now refuses a set / frozenset of tuples used as the key of a
container that is not a table dict (`tupexpr.ex_Subscript`, `tupstmt.assign_one`) and bails on a module-level
constant whose type cannot be told and that mentions a tuple (`tuplib.module_assign`), so the whole program is
left as written and the general path keeps the dict and the key boxed. Added `test_ail_pre112.py` (4 programs,
two builds each). Verified with 15 differential probes (`cmp.sh`, both builds) plus `test_ail_tuples`,
`test_ail_safetynet`, `test_ail_files`, `test_ail_corpus_findings3`, `test_ail_collections`,
`test_ail_sets_general` and `test_ail_modconst`.
## 2026-10-24 - pre113: fold all-int constant expressions exactly

`(1 << 63) - 1` and `2**65 - 2**65` are exact in Python even though an intermediate is outside
int64; both builds used to emit checked operations for the intermediate and stopped with
`integer overflow`.  `pyfront.int_constant` now evaluates an all-int constant expression with
Python ints (with a size limit for giant intermediates), and the typed IR, legacy typed emitter,
unified general path and boxed emitters emit the one int64 result.  Added `test_ail_pre113.py`
(one program, four build modes); the second listed case, a module constant exponent, is still a
separate difference.

## 2026-10-23 - C compiler step cache (job-ctime3-10232149)

The base export already contains the content-addressed `cc` layer in
`AIL_CURRENT/python/pkg-v12/buildcache.py` (`buildcache.run_cc`, activated by `--cache`, stored under
`$AIL_CACHE` / `~/.cache/ail`, off with `AIL_NO_CACHE=1` or `--no-cache`). The task says not to add
a second cache when one already exists, so this job verifies and measures that layer and adds a
regression test for the exact reuse case:

* `test_changed_source_with_the_same_generated_c_hits_the_cc_cache` changes a typed local's name,
  which changes the merged source text (a new front-end entry) but not the generated C: the C
  compiler step is skipped and the executable is byte-identical.

Measurement on this 4-core runner, gcc 13.3, median of 5 runs, `AIL_CACHE` in a temporary
directory. "before" is `AIL_NO_CACHE=1`; "after" is a cache warm from the same C text with a new
front-end key (a renamed local), so the front end runs but the C compiler step hits. Wall time is
the whole `ail_chatgpt.py compile`; C time is the sum of the compiler wrapper's own runs (after
includes the cache's one-time toolchain probes).

| gdev program | wall before | C before | wall after | C after | outputs |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| g00_000 | 1.245 s | 0.241 s | 1.177 s | 0.013 s | identical |
| g00_002 | 1.427 s | 0.393 s | 1.186 s | 0.012 s | identical |
| g00_004 | 2.540 s | 1.418 s | 1.279 s | 0.012 s | identical |

Output SHA-256 values were equal for every before/after pair. With an unchanged source the whole
front-end cache also hits, so the compiler step is not run at all.
# Devlog

## 2026-10-22

* fuzz21 (unpacking): the general path's `UNPACK_SEQUENCE` errors now use CPython's wording and
  counts -- `too many values to unpack (expected N)`, `not enough values to unpack (expected N, got M)`,
  `(expected at least N, got M)` for a starred target, and `cannot unpack non-iterable X object`.
  Added `AIL_CURRENT/test_ail_fuzz21.py` and registered it in `ail_check.MODULES`.
## 2026-10-23 - fuzz45: float // and % use CPython's float_divmod

The general path's boxed operators and the unified pass emitted `floor(a / b)` for float `//` and a
bare `fmod` for float `%`.  `1.0 // 0.1` was 10.0 (CPython 9.0), `-0.0 % 2.0` was -0.0 (CPython
0.0), `-5.0 // inf` was -0.0 (CPython -1.0) and `inf // 2.0` was inf (CPython nan).  Both now use
one CPython float_divmod helper, so `//`, `%` and `divmod` agree, including zero-remainder signs,
infinities and NaNs.  Added `test_ail_fuzz45.py` (5 programs, two builds each).
## 2026-10-22

- job-fuzz39-10230820 (review fix): a name whose bindings mix a tuple and a number is no longer treated as a known
  tuple for the number check, so `x = (1,); x = 2.5; z = 2.5; x is z` is refused with C115 again instead of printing
  False. The `is(` spelling no longer bypasses the refusal in `numidentity.py` / `pyboxed2.py` (text gate is a word
  match, not the literal `' is '`). Added both cases to `test_ail_fuzz39.py`.
- job-fuzz39-10230820: `is` / `is not` with an equal tuple constant (including one passed to both parameters of a
  generic function) is refused by name instead of answering False where CPython answers True. Added
  `AIL_CURRENT/test_ail_fuzz39.py` and extended `numidentity.py`; `tuplib.py` leaves such a comparison for the refusal.
## 2026-10-23 - fuzz43: str.startswith/endswith tuple member type names

A non-str member of a tuple passed to `str.startswith`/`str.endswith` raised the right
`TypeError` but named the runtime tag rather than the member's class: a bytes member printed
`not instance` where CPython prints `not bytes`, and a user-class member was flattened to
`instance` too. The message now resolves the member object's class name (the prelude bytes class
or the user class) on both builds. Added `test_ail_fuzz43.py`, which also keeps valid tuples,
short-circuiting before a later bad member, empty receivers and windowed calls compared with
CPython. Other observed differences, not fixed here: `bytes.__contains__` with a str item and
bytes search with wrong-type bounds still print different TypeError text (different causes);
the non-ASCII `lower`/`upper` limit remains a documented pre-existing difference.
## 2026-10-23

- fuzz70: `assert cond, msg` now keeps the message object in `AssertionError.args` on the general
  path (`ail2x_raise_builtin`), so tuple/list/dict/None/custom messages match CPython's `str(e)`
  and `e.args`. A mixed-mode typed clone is no longer selected for a function that asserts, so a
  failed assert inside a helper is caught by the surrounding boxed `try`. Typed-only builds still
  refuse a tuple assert message by name. New coverage: `test_ail_fuzz70.py`.
## 2026-10-22 - fuzz8 review 2 fixes (job-fuzz8-10221632)

1. `_attribute_kind` / `_attribute_container` now add the attribute to the recursion guard `seen`
   and return `None` on a cycle instead of recursing forever.  `b.x = b.x + 1` (or `b.x = b.x`)
   together with `itertools.accumulate(..., initial=b.x)` or `groupby([b.x, ...])` no longer aborts
   every build with `RecursionError`; the typed path declines and the default build falls back,
   matching CPython (`[2, 3.5]`, `1 [1, 1]` / `2 [2]`).
2. Corrected `DIFFERENCES.md` row `C?-job-fuzz8-10221632-2`: mutable-element groupby keys do not
   run on a typed recompute.  `--strict` refuses the pattern (`'_ilN_gc' is read before it is
   assigned`) and the default build uses the general path.

`AIL_CURRENT/test_ail_fuzz8.py` covers self-referential and cross-name attribute cycles through
arguments, list items, dict values, nested attributes and groupby.  Probes:
`/tmp/probes/attr_cycle_acc.py`, `attr_cycle_self.py`, `attr_cycle_groupby.py`,
`attr_cycle_two_names.py`, `attr_cycle_nested.py`, `attr_cycle_float.py`,
`attr_cycle_dict_list.py`.

## 2026-10-22 - fuzz8 review fixes (job-fuzz8-10221632)

1. `itertools.groupby` no longer reuses a stale look-ahead key for a list of mutable elements.
   The typed path still declines that pattern (`--strict`: `'_ilN_gc' is read before it is
   assigned`) and the default build falls back to the general path, which matches CPython.
   Scalar/str element lists stay on the typed path and call the key once per element.  Probe
   `gb_cache_regress_len.py` prints `1 3` / `3 1`.
2. `itertools.accumulate(xs, initial=v)` on the typed path is refused by name when the types of
   `v` and the elements differ.  One-argument `round()` is now classified as `int` through local
   bindings, list items, attributes and dict values, so the float-list probe falls back to the
   general path and prints `[2, 3.5, 6.0]` instead of `[2.0, 3.5, 6.0]`.

`AIL_CURRENT/test_ail_fuzz8.py` has both cases; the typed groupby/accumulate modules, safetynet,
files and corpus_findings3 pass on the final commit.


## 2026-10-21 - fuzz8: iteration tools (job-fuzz8-10220554)

Ran 65 small differential programs over chain / islice / product / permutations / combinations /
combinations_with_replacement / accumulate / groupby / zip_longest / starmap / enumerate /
zip(strict=) / sorted / min / max / reversed / map / filter, each through `bash ~/tools/cmp.sh`
on the default build and `AIL_UNIFIED_FORCE=1`.  Fixed three causes (all now in
`AIL_CURRENT/test_ail_fuzz8.py`, with probes in `/tmp/probes`):

1. `itertools.accumulate(..., initial=None)` now treats None as "not given", as CPython 3.12 does
   (`cruntime.ail_it_accumulate`).  Constant, argument, list-item, attribute and dict-value routes
   are tested.
2. `sorted` / `list.sort` call their key on the input in the original order even for
   `reverse=True`, and call it once for a one-element list (`cruntime.ail_list_sort`).  Before, the
   elements were reversed before the key calls, which only showed with a key that has a side effect.
3. The typed path's `itertools.groupby` reuses the look-ahead key, so it calls the key exactly once
   per element instead of twice on each group boundary (`itlib.Groupby`).

Remaining differences found are recorded in `DIFFERENCES.md`; they were not fixed in this job.

- job-fuzz82: typed path refuses `del` on an item of a module-level numeric list by name.
  Before, `del xs[-1]` was a silent no-op (the const table's `.n` write was dropped) and an
  earlier index memmoved over const data and crashed; the default build now falls back to the
  general path and matches CPython. Added `AIL_CURRENT/test_ail_fuzz82.py`.

- String encoding: a run-time encoding name now accepts every CPython alias of `utf-8`, `ascii`
  and `latin-1` (`csascii`, `cp367`, `ibm367`, `csisolatin1`, `ibm819`, `utf8_ucs2`,
  `utf8_ucs4`, ...), on both builds. Literal spellings are accepted by `safetyrt.ENCODINGS`
  instead of refused by name. New test: `test_ail_fuzz61`.
# Development log

## 2026-10-23 — job-fuzz65-10231438 (heapq/bisect)

- Found: `heappush(h, "x")` on an annotated `list[int]` raises TypeError after CPython has already appended the string. When the same file also compares tuples (a `bisect` on `list[tuple[int, int]]`), `tuplegen.lrepr` generated an int-specialized `str(x)` for each element, so `print(h)` showed `x` instead of `'x'` (silent wrong stdout, exit 0, both builds). The same helper raised a spurious TypeError while printing a `list[str]` that held an appended int.
- Fixed `tuplegen.lrepr`: scalar list elements use `repr(x)`, so the value's own repr is used; compound elements keep their existing helper.
- Added `AIL_CURRENT/test_ail_fuzz65.py` and registered it in `ail_check.py`.
- Other observed, not fixed: `list[tuple]` heaps with a wrong-typed item still fail while printing (`int` not subscriptable) instead of printing CPython's list; `nan`/`inf` literals remain refused by name.
## 2026-10-23 -- job-fuzz89-10231611

- Fixed the general path's `bytes`/`bytearray` whitespace `split`/`rsplit` when `maxsplit` is
  reached: the remainder now keeps the outer whitespace, as CPython does
  (`b" a ".split(None, 0) == [b"a "]`, `b"  a  b  ".rsplit(None, 1) == [b"  a", b"b"]`).
  The typed-path loops already had CPython's rule.
- Added `test_ail_fuzz89.py` (both builds against CPython) and registered it in `ail_check.py`.
