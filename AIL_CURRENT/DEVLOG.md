## 2026-10-24 - comprehension stores and binary64 copies (job-perf6-10240916)

`numeric_scale_binary` spends most of its time in the generated `float_values_scale`, whose
comprehension reserved the exact result size and then called `ail_flist_push` for every element.
For a counted, unfiltered comprehension over an int or float list, the compiler now writes
`list.p[list.n++] = value` directly when the element expression contains no calls (which is what
could move the source list under the loop). A float element built only from names, reads and
`+ - *` also gets `#pragma omp simd`; `pyc.py` adds `-fopenmp-simd` so GCC vectorizes that one
loop, while `-fno-tree-slp-vectorize` stays in force for the struct-of-doubles reason it was added.
`F64CODEC` now takes `unpack_float64`/`pack_float64` buffers from `ail_alloc_raw` instead of the
zeroing `ail_alloc`, since both paths overwrite every byte before anyone reads it.

`python3 bench/compare.py --app numeric_scale_binary`: ail/c went from 1.371 [1.360, 1.382] to
1.226 [1.217, 1.235], ail/base 0.895 [0.885, 0.906] (about 10.5% faster); output was identical and
the ranges do not overlap. Probes over int/float comprehensions (empty, negative, aliased, sliced,
argument/attribute/dict/list-item sources, calls, filters, mid-loop exceptions, repeated loops)
matched CPython on both builds.
## 2026-10-24 -- bytes.count memmem: self-contained declaration (job-perf7-10240917)

Review found the short-needle `bytes.count` path called `memmem` without a declaration in the
emitted C, so `gcc -std=c11` (a mode AIL uses for `to_c` and C-object builds) assumed an implicit
`int` return and truncated the pointer (segfault). The `BYTES` block now declares `memmem`
itself on non-Windows, after `<string.h>`; glibc and musl both export the symbol, and the
declaration is compatible with the header's when `_GNU_SOURCE`/`_DEFAULT_SOURCE` is set.
`rp7_count_small.py` now prints `4 2 2` under `-std=c11 -O2` and `-std=gnu17`; all count probes
match CPython on both builds, and `binary_search` is unchanged at 64.9 ms vs base 92.0 ms
(`ail/base 0.711 [0.706,0.717]`). Required tests pass.

## 2026-10-24 -- bytes.count: memmem for short needles (job-perf7-10240917)

`binary_search` (`count` of a 7-byte needle over a 64 MiB file) spent ~69 ms of its 94 ms in
`ail_bytes_count_range`, which used the byte-pair Horspool scan. For a short needle glibc
`memmem` is about twice as fast on the same data (38 ms vs 71 ms), so the non-Windows
short-needle path now uses the same non-overlapping `memmem` loop as the C reference; Windows
keeps Horspool. `bench/compare.py --app binary_search`: base 98.2 ms, new 69.2 ms
(AIL/C 1.414 -> 0.994, ranges non-overlapping). Probes for empty, negative, windowed and
64-byte needles through arguments, list items, attributes and dict values match CPython on both
builds.
## 2026-10-24 -- pre26: repr(e.args[i]) keeps the argument's kind

On the typed path `e.args[i]` reads as text, so `repr(e.args[i])` repr'd that text: a
`ValueError(3.0)` handler printed `'3.0'` where CPython prints `3.0`, and int, bool and None
arguments were quoted the same way.  The handler rewrite now lowers `repr(e.args[i])`,
`f"{e.args[i]!r}"` and `%r` of one argument to a new `_ail_exc_arg_repr` accessor that formats
the stored argument (a str keeps its quotes, a number does not).  Both builds agree with
CPython; `test_ail_pre26.py` keeps the probe, including negative and out-of-range indexes.

## 2026-10-23 -- fuzz37: ordering TypeError names the written operator

Fuzzing while loops and counters against CPython on both builds found that an
ordering comparison between built-in values that cannot be ordered raised
`TypeError '<' not supported ...` for every operator.  `while s > 0` with
`s = "5"` printed `'<'` where CPython prints `'>'`, and `<=`, `>`, `>=` and
chained comparisons had the same wrong symbol.  The general-path comparison
helper now receives the operator symbol from `ail_op_lt/le/gt/ge`, passes it
through nested list/tuple comparisons, and uses it in the message; callers such
as sorting keep `<`.  Both builds now match CPython.  `test_ail_fuzz37.py`
keeps the probe.  Also seen but not changed: the general build refuses an
integer literal outside int64 range that the default build accepts, and
`sorted([1, "x"])` names the operand types in the opposite order from CPython
(`'int' and 'str'` instead of `'str' and 'int'`); both are pre-existing.
