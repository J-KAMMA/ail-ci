## 2026-10-25 - pre125 reapply: module-scope bare attribute/subscript annotations

The accepted pre125 change proposed refusing `obj.attr: note()` / `xs[i]: note()` by name because
the old surface evaluated neither the target nor the annotation. This tree already contains the
pre124 fix, which evaluates the target's base object and index expressions and then the annotation
in CPython order on both builds. Refusing here would regress that fix, so both changes are kept:
pre124's evaluation stands, and `test_ail_pre125.py` re-applies pre125's cases as CPython-parity
regressions (also a bare annotation on a plain name, `count: int`, unchanged). Probes:
`ann_attr_module.py`, `ann_sub_module.py`, `ann_attr_nested.py`, `ann_sub_empty_negative.py`,
`ann_sub_slice.py`, `ann_attr_alias.py`, `ann_sub_dict_str.py`, `ann_sub_arg_item_attr.py`,
`ann_attr_static.py`, `ann_sub_future.py`, and `ann_name_type.py`; all matched CPython on both
builds.

## 2026-10-25 -- pre186: enumerate counter past INT64_MAX stops by name (job-pre186-10251543)

The first still-differing pre-existing item from `fuzz48` was the `enumerate` counter: starting at
`9223372036854775806`, the general iterator wrapped through `INT64_MAX` and printed
`-9223372036854775808`, where CPython prints `9223372036854775808`.  AIL ints are 64-bit, so the
next value after `INT64_MAX` has no representation.  The shared `AIL_IT_ENUMERATE` step now keeps
the last representable index and, if another item exists, raises
`OverflowError: enumerate() index integer overflow`; the old materialised
`ail_builtin_enumerate` gets the same guard.  Every counter that fits still matches CPython
(including an empty iterable at `INT64_MAX`, one item at `INT64_MAX`, negative starts, and starts
reaching the call through an argument, list item, attribute, dict value, a for loop and `next()`).
`AIL_CURRENT/test_ail_pre186.py` covers both builds; probes are `pre186_enum_*` in `/tmp/probes`.
The second reviewer item, `range(0, 5, 0)` being accepted, was reproduced but left open.
## 2026-10-25 -- statically known unary int64 overflow (job-rbpre172-10251601)

The first pre-existing difference left by job-pre108 was pure unary overflow: `-MIN`, both on a
module constant and as `-(-9223372036854775808)`, compiled on the default build and then stopped at
run time with `integer overflow`, while CPython printed a bignum; the general path refused the
`MIN` literal with a different message. A new front-end check evaluates unary `+`/`-` over integer
literals and module-level int constants and refuses an out-of-int64 result by name (`int64 constant
expression out of range: ...`) on both builds. A module constant shadowed by a parameter is not
folded, and values that only reach the unary operation as variables keep the fixed-width trap.
Added `test_ail_pre172.py` and registered it in `ail_check.MODULES`.

## 2026-10-24 -- bytes.count memmem: self-contained declaration (job-perf7-10240917)

Review found the short-needle `bytes.count` path called `memmem` without a declaration in the
emitted C, so `gcc -std=c11` (a mode AIL uses for `to_c` and C-object builds) assumed an implicit
`int` return and truncated the pointer (segfault). The `BYTES` block now declares `memmem`
itself on non-Windows, after `<string.h>`; glibc and musl both export the symbol, and the
declaration is compatible with the header's when `_GNU_SOURCE`/`_DEFAULT_SOURCE` is set.
`rp7_count_small.py` now prints `4 2 2` under `-std=c11 -O2` and `-std=gnu17`; all count probes
match CPython on both builds, and `binary_search` is unchanged at 64.9 ms vs base 92.0 ms
(`ail/base 0.711 [0.706,0.717]`). Required tests pass.

## 2026-10-24 -- bytes.count: memmem for short needles (job-perf7-10240917)

`binary_search` (`count` of a 7-byte needle over a 64 MiB file) spent ~69 ms of its 94 ms in
`ail_bytes_count_range`, which used the byte-pair Horspool scan. For a short needle glibc
`memmem` is about twice as fast on the same data (38 ms vs 71 ms), so the non-Windows
short-needle path now uses the same non-overlapping `memmem` loop as the C reference; Windows
keeps Horspool. `bench/compare.py --app binary_search`: base 98.2 ms, new 69.2 ms
(AIL/C 1.414 -> 0.994, ranges non-overlapping). Probes for empty, negative, windowed and
64-byte needles through arguments, list items, attributes and dict values match CPython on both
builds.
## 2026-10-24 -- pre173: bytes start/end bounds use CPython's slice-index rules

The general path's bytes/bytearray `find`, `rfind`, `count`, `index`, `rindex`, `startswith` and
`endswith` read the optional start/end bounds straight from the boxed value, so `b"abc".find(b"a",
"x")` raised `'<' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'` instead of CPython's
`slice indices must be integers or None or have an __index__ method`.  One C primitive
(`ail2b_index` in safetyrt.py) now converts a bound exactly as `_PyEval_SliceIndex` does: an int, a
bool or an instance's `__index__` (with CPython's `__index__ returned non-int (type ...)` when the
result is not an int); `None` keeps its default.  `_ail_b_rng` keeps the clamping, and all seven
methods share it.  `test_ail_pre173.py` covers both builds and keeps the case.
## 2026-10-24 -- pre100: `%d` of a float on the general path

CPython truncates a float for `%d` and prints the whole integer even past int64 (`"%d" % 1e20`
prints `100000000000000000000`). The literal-format path rejected a float with
`TypeError: unsupported format string passed to non-int`, and the run-time formatter stopped at
the int64 boundary with `AIL limit: integer overflow`. Literal `%d` conversions now go through
the run-time formatter (`pyboxed2._percent_format` -> `safetyrt.FMT`), and that formatter's
integer branch formats the truncated float as decimal digits directly instead of as an int64.
NaN and infinity keep CPython's ValueError / OverflowError. Probes:
`/tmp/probes/pre100_float_d*.py`, `pct_dynamic_float.py`; new test
`AIL_CURRENT/test_ail_pre100.py`.

## 2026-10-24 - pre104: round() of nan/inf raises CPython's exception

The pre54 review recorded the default build's one-argument `round()` of nan/inf as a
pre-existing difference: it stopped through `ail_die` with `round() of nan` or
`round() result does not fit in this language's int64`, so a `try` could not catch it and an
uncaught program printed the trap message instead of CPython's exception line.  `ail_round0`
now raises `ValueError("cannot convert float NaN to integer")` and
`OverflowError("cannot convert float infinity to integer")` through the normal exception path
on both builds.  Finite values, including the int64-boundary trap, are unchanged.  Added
`AIL_CURRENT/test_ail_pre104.py` and registered it in `ail_check.MODULES`.
## 2026-10-23 -- fuzz37: ordering TypeError names the written operator

Fuzzing while loops and counters against CPython on both builds found that an
ordering comparison between built-in values that cannot be ordered raised
`TypeError '<' not supported ...` for every operator.  `while s > 0` with
`s = "5"` printed `'<'` where CPython prints `'>'`, and `<=`, `>`, `>=` and
chained comparisons had the same wrong symbol.  The general-path comparison
helper now receives the operator symbol from `ail_op_lt/le/gt/ge`, passes it
through nested list/tuple comparisons, and uses it in the message; callers such
as sorting keep `<`.  Both builds now match CPython.  `test_ail_fuzz37.py`
keeps the probe.  Also seen but not changed: the general build refuses an
integer literal outside int64 range that the default build accepts, and
`sorted([1, "x"])` names the operand types in the opposite order from CPython
(`'int' and 'str'` instead of `'str' and 'int'`); both are pre-existing.
