# ffwasm2: WASI refusals by name, the remaining compare-lab tasks, and a size table against Rust's wasm32-wasi

Time budget: 60 minutes. Commit and push after each sub-step. Follow `C:\Users\bluec\ail-work\agent-brief-rules.md`
(no regressions, CI first, memory cap).

**Number this moves:** (a) compare-lab tasks matching CPython under wasmtime: from ffwasm1's count to 10/10, or each
remaining one refused at build time by name. (b) `.wasm` bytes against `rustc --target wasm32-wasip1 -O` of the
same compare-lab Rust source, per task (geomean). No silent link failure and no trap at run time may remain.

Base: `origin/integ` with ffwasm1 merged. Files you may create or edit, and no others:
- `tools/wasm_build.py`, `tools/wasm_shim.h`
- `AIL_CURRENT/python/pkg-v12/proclib.py`, `threadlib.py`, `socklib.py` (if merged), `siglib.py` (if merged): only
  a check that refuses the module by name when the target platform is `wasi`, with a `write instead:` line
- `lab/wasm/RESULTS.md`, `AIL_CURRENT/test_ail_wasm.py`

## Sub-steps

1. **Refusals (20 min).** Make `import subprocess`, `threading`, `socket`, `signal` refuse at build time for wasi
   with a message naming WASI. A program refused today by a linker error must be refused by name instead. Commit,
   push, open the PR.
2. **Remaining tasks (25 min).** Fix the shim for each remaining task (stack size via `-Wl,-z,stack-size=`, file
   preopens, `clock_gettime`). A RecursionError must stay loud (owner rule: never SIGSEGV, never a WASM trap without a
   message): test a deep recursion program.
3. **Size table (15 min).** Rust side only if `rustup target list --installed` has `wasm32-wasip1`; otherwise record
   that and stop step 3. Strip both (`wasm-strip` if present, else note it).

## Done-check

- 10/10 compare-lab tasks either match under wasmtime or are refused by name at build time; 0 linker errors and
  0 traps without a message.
- The size table is in `RESULTS.md`; the test passes; the 20 shards pass.

## Stop rule

Stop on any output difference. Stop if a refusal check needs `pyfunc.py` or `ail_chatgpt.py`. Stop when 60 minutes
pass. Push first.

## Appendix A: standing rules (from agent-brief-rules.md)

1. No regressions: a program that built and matched CPython before must still do so in the default build. A loud
   stop is allowed only where the value cannot be computed. Never silent wrong output: stop and report the moment
   any program prints something CPython does not.
2. Probe ints beyond int64 wherever ints come from text or arithmetic; run probes in the default build and with
   `AIL_UNIFIED_FORCE=1`, compare both with `python3`.
3. Push early, open the PR against `integ`, wait for all 20 `shard` checks (`gh pr checks <n> -R J-KAMMA/ail-ci`, at most
   once every 10 minutes). Report only when all pass, or say which fail and why.
4. Branch from `integ` (or one unmerged PR at most).
5. Memory: wrap heavy runs in `ulimit -v 1500000`; `tools/par_check.py -j 2` at most; leave no background jobs.
6. New test module: `AIL_CURRENT/tests.d/<module>.txt` if the directory exists, else `ail_check.py` MODULES; `git add`,
   `tools/update_manifest.py`, then `tools/update_manifest.py --check`.
7. Never print credentials, run a broad pkill, merge PRs, change repository settings, cancel runs, tag, publish, or edit
   `.github/workflows`.
8. Never edit `AIL_CURRENT/ail_chatgpt.py`, `AIL_CURRENT/ail_syntax.py`, `AIL_CURRENT/python/pkg-v12/pyfunc.py`,
   `pyc.py`, `buildcache.py`, `pyboxed2.py`, or `packaging/ail_lang/cli.py`, unless this task names the file and
   the one minimal hook it may add there (owner decision 3 of 2026-11-06: only when no other running job edits that
   file). Do not edit `DEVLOG.md` either: put your notes in the files this task names. Edit only the files this task
   names, plus the manifest files that `tools/update_manifest.py` writes.

## Appendix B: repository facts

- Build: `python3 -B AIL_CURRENT/ail_chatgpt.py compile SRC -o OUT [--strict] [--debug-dir DIR]`. `DIR/program.c` is
  the generated C. `--strict` means the typed path or a refusal. `-o` must not exist yet. A fallback to the general
  path prints `note: ... built on the general path ...` on stderr.
- AIL is Python syntax plus optional annotations. Ints are int64, and overflow stops loudly. Release builds use
  gcc -O2.
- Library policy: a small spec library is written in AIL (`AIL_CURRENT/stdlib/*.py`, found by `ail_modules.py`
  `BUNDLED_DIR`); TLS, signatures and SQLite go through proven native libraries.
- Runtime-backed modules follow `AIL_CURRENT/python/pkg-v12/proclib.py` (stage G8, subprocess): a tree-to-tree pass
  plus a C core header (`ailproc_core.h`), wired by two lines in `filelib.py` (`PRIMS.update(...)` near line 66 and
  `rewrite_tree(...)` near line 152). A program that does not import the module must produce byte-identical C.
- CPython 3.12 is the oracle: compare stdout and the exit status, and stderr where a task says so.
- Speed claims: instruction counts with `tools/icount.c`, output unchanged.

## Owner decision (2026-11-06)

- Fetching external tools is allowed when they come from the official source and their version is pinned and recorded: wasmtime, the Rust wasm32-wasip1 target, crates from crates.io (regex, vendored deps), and PyPI metadata.

**Rules for every job.**
- **Load:** you are one of up to five agents on a 16 GB PC. Keep local parallelism at 2 (`-j 2`) and never run the whole suite; the full suite runs on CI after merge.
- **Commits:** commit with explicit `git add` on your branch. Messages end with a `Co-Authored-By:` line naming the model you actually are (Claude: `Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>` or `Claude Sonnet 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`; other models: omit the line).
- **Forbidden:** push, stash, rebase, reset, and deletion outside /tmp.
- **Records:**
  - New DIFFERENCES rows use placeholder ids `C?-<your branch>-N`.
  - Add a DEVLOG entry at the top with today's date.
  - Register a new test module: if `AIL_CURRENT/tests.d/` exists, add `AIL_CURRENT/tests.d/<module>.txt` containing the module
    name and do NOT edit the tuple in `ail_check.py`; otherwise append it to the `MODULES` tuple.
  - `git add` new files, run `python3 tools/update_manifest.py`, then `--check`. Do not hand-edit `MANIFEST.json` or `manifest.d/`.
- **Required tests:** the targeted modules for what you touch, plus test_ail_safetynet, test_ail_files and test_ail_corpus_findings3. Run them on your final commit, not an earlier one.
- **Mandatory self-check before you report.** A reviewer will repeat it, and past reports were wrong about half the time.
  1. Write probe programs in /tmp/probes/ for every behaviour you changed. Cover the boundaries your implementation implies, not only the example: types, widths, empty, negative, aliasing, values reaching the code through an argument, a list item, an attribute and a dict value, and both builds.
  2. Run each probe with `bash ~/tools/cmp.sh /tmp/probes/<p>.py $PWD`.
  3. Every probe must match CPython or be refused by name.
  4. List the probes and their results in the report.
- **Never claim something works unless a probe or test you ran shows it.** If you did not verify something, say so.
- **Tokens:** use grep -n, narrow reads, and `tail` on long logs.
- **Budget:** stop at the budget note, leaving a committed, consistent state.
- **Report:** keep it brief, with numbers.
- Test data: email addresses only on example.com / example.org (the public export audit rejects any other domain).

**Work in few steps** (each step costs model time):
- Write all probe programs first, then run them together with one command, for example a loop over `bash ~/tools/cmp.sh`, instead of one command per program.
- Search only inside the repository (`grep -rn ... AIL_CURRENT tools`), never across `/home` or `/tmp`.
- Read a file once, using a range that is large enough, instead of many small reads.
- Do not re-run a test that already passed unless you changed code since.

**Where you run:** a GitHub Actions runner (4 cores). Commit your work on the current branch; do not push.
