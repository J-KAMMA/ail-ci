**Find and fix silent wrong answers in one area: printf-style % formatting (%s %r %d %i %x %o %e %g %c with width, precision, flags - + 0 space #, %% and dict-based %(name)s, tuples as single arguments, errors for too few or too many arguments).** Write 30 or more small random programs in this area, including edge cases: empty, zero, negative, huge, wrong types, nesting. Run each with `bash ~/tools/cmp.sh` on both builds.

For every program whose stdout differs from CPython with no error, either fix the cause or refuse it by name at compile time. Fix at most 3 causes and list the rest in your report. Add the fixed cases as tests in a new `test_ail_fuzz16.py`, then commit.

**Rules for every job.**
- **Load:** you are one of up to five agents on a 16 GB PC. Keep local parallelism at 2 (`-j 2`) and never run the whole suite; the full suite runs on CI after merge.
- **Commits:** commit with explicit `git add` on your branch. Messages end with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
- **Forbidden:** push, stash, rebase, reset, and deletion outside /tmp.
- **Records:**
  - New DIFFERENCES rows use placeholder ids `C?-<your branch>-N`.
  - Add a DEVLOG entry at the top with today's date.
  - Run `python3 tools/update_manifest.py`, then `--check`.
- **Required tests:** the targeted modules for what you touch, plus test_ail_safetynet, test_ail_files and test_ail_corpus_findings3. Run them on your final commit, not an earlier one.
- **Mandatory self-check before you report.** A reviewer will repeat it, and past reports were wrong about half the time.
  1. Write probe programs in /tmp/probes/ for every behaviour you changed. Cover the boundaries your implementation implies, not only the example: types, widths, empty, negative, aliasing, values reaching the code through an argument, a list item, an attribute and a dict value, and both builds.
  2. Run each probe with `bash ~/tools/cmp.sh /tmp/probes/<p>.py $PWD`.
  3. Every probe must match CPython or be refused by name.
  4. List the probes and their results in the report.
- **Never claim something works unless a probe or test you ran shows it.** If you did not verify something, say so.
- **Tokens:** use grep -n, narrow reads, and `tail` on long logs.
- **Budget:** stop at the budget note, leaving a committed, consistent state.
- **Report:** keep it brief, with numbers.
- Test data: email addresses only on example.com / example.org (the public export audit rejects any other domain).

**Where you run:** a GitHub Actions runner (4 cores). Commit your work on the current branch; do not push.
